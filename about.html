                I have recently started my new journey into the area of software development.
                I have experience in researching, designing and implementing websites. 
                In particular, I enjoy writing with efficient code and developing webpages that are clear, functional and ensure user confidence. 
                In addition to writing efficient code, I enjoy the testing and debugging phase of programming, which is vital to identify any areas that require modification for the program to run more smoothly. 
                I understand operational practicality and firmly believe in taking a less is more approach when evaluating new website designs. 
                I welcome collaboration working closely with a range of professionals from various academic disciplines or technical backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                My academic background in archaeology and museum studies has made me fortunate enough to participate in a number of internships and field schools. 
                When I participated in an internship at the Národní Muzeum in Prague, Czech Republic, I was able to provide support in the areas of collections management, documentation, exhibition design and community engagement. 
                During my project work within the archaeological and ethnographic departments, I developed an interest in the cross-cultural exchange between both by peers within the internship program and my supervisors. 
                This was enhanced when we were able to provide support through photography and filming during the traditional Easter celebrations. 
                These celebrations created a conversation surrounding traditions in each other’s home countries, which in turn was incorporated back into exhibition research. 
                One of the most enjoyable aspects of the internship was being able to engage and work with a wide variety of museum professionals from diverse academic backgrounds.

            <p>
                I developed my interest in language learning through travelling to Europe for work. 
                I found having a basic understanding of important phrases and words enabled me to navigate outside the tourist hub and explore unknown areas. 
                Connecting with the local people in their native language also provided me with the opportunity to deepen my understanding of other cultures. 
                This understanding also led to a greater appreciation of the history, traditions, and arts of each place I was visiting. Furthermore, my experience in learning another language has changed the way that I think and approach problems. 
                Nevertheless, it has required commitment, time and dedication to learn and maintain new vocabulary. 
                Through acknowledging that I live in an interconnected world I have an ambition to progress with my language proficiency in German.

            <p>
                Seeing the world, understanding different perspectives, customs and cultures and exploring history are only a few reasons why I appreciate traveling. 
                Travelling to new places and discovering new ideas encourages me to reflect on my own circumstances and how I am developing in my life. 
                Traveling is more than just a holiday; it is a vocation. 
                I find that it encourages you to challenge yourself to adapt to new environments that may be outside of your comfort zone. 
                Through my travelling experiences I have been able to swim between two continents, island hop throughout the Mediterranean, engage in meaningful conversation with locals, and develop life-long friendships.
