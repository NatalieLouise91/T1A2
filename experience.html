            <h1>My Work Experience</h1>
            <p>I have an academic background in the social sciences, in which I hold qualifications from the University of Queensland in the areas of Archaeology and Museum Studies. 
                During my Master of Museum Studies Degree, I engaged in an internship at the Národní Muzeum in Prague, Czech Republic. 
                This internship focused on collections management, documentation, exhibition design and community engagement. 
                After successfully graduating with a Master of Museum Studies degree, I provided curatorial and collection management support at the MacArthur Museum in Brisbane. 
                This year, I hope to expand my knowledge base and develop a foundational understanding in computer science and experience in programming languages for website development. </p>

            <h2>Bachelor of Arts</h2>
            <p>My Bachelor of Arts degree facilitated background knowledge in the fields of archaeology, anthropology, and ancient history. 
                Academic writing was also a focus in this degree to provide engaging factual content to both academic and public audiences.</p>

            <h2>Master of Museum Studies</h2>
            <p>A Master in Museum Studies provided me with interdisciplinary training in the museum and cultural heritage industry. 
                Over the last few years, this degree has provided professional training in collection management, exhibition planning, community outreach programs, and cultural heritage law. 
                My research for my final dissertation project focused on the effectiveness of digital learning in online environments. </p>
